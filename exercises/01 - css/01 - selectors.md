## #Instructions
- The game consists of 32 levels.
- In each level There is scene described uisng an `HTML`-like file that contains some made up elements like `<plate>`, `<bento>` etc. 
- The target of each level is to select specific elements from the scene, using `CSS Selectors`
- To solve the level, you need to write the correct selector inside the `CSS Editor` in the line dedicated to that.
