## EXERCISE - Small projects
### Getting Started
In each of these exercises, you have an `html` file with a `<style>` section. In each file you have a problem which you should fix only by modifying the CSS.

### Steps
1. in `flex-box-1.html` We have a main title, and a sub title. <br>
![initial](images/fb-1.1.png)<br>
We want that when there is enough space, the titles will be arraned next to each other so that the sub title is aligned to the end of the line: <br>
![desired](images/fb-1.2.png)<br>
But when there is not enough space for both texts next to each other, the subtitle will wrap to the next line: <br>
![desired](images/fb-1.3.png)


2. in `flex-box-2.html` you have a page that looks like this:<br> ![problem](images/fb-2.1.png)<br> Make the required changes to make it look like this: <br>![solution](images/fb-2.2.png)

3. in `flex-box-3.html` you have a page containing some items in `<div>` tags. <br>

Make the required changes to make it look like this:<br>
